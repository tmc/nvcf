Hello World

# NGC Account Access [](\#ngc-account-access "Permalink to this headline")

NVIDIA Cloud Functions is hosted on NVIDIA’s NGC platform. This overview gives a quick run down on how to log in to your account the first time. For detailed instructions on adding and managing users within your organization as the organization owner, please see the [NGC User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-user-guide/index.html#accessing-ngc-org-owner).

When you are invited to an NGC organization with the Cloud Functions product enabled on it, your Cloud Functions account will be tied to both an NGC organization, and an NCA (NVIDIA Cloud Account) ID.
