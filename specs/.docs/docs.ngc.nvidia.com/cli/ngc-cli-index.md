NVIDIA NGC CLI is a command-line interface tool for managing Docker containers in the NVIDIA NGC Registry.
With NGC CLI, you can perform the same operations that are available from the NGC website, such as running jobs,
viewing ACE and node information, and viewing Docker repositories within your orgs.
